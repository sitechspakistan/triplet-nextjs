                            In the beginning, there was just an idea. A simple one, really: videos can do what words
                            alone can’t. They can ignite excitement, simplify the complicated, and bring people together
                            over shared knowledge.<br /><br />

                            That idea? It stuck with us, and it’s been our North Star since day one.<br /><br />

                            It was 2016, and we weren’t some big-shot agency with a fancy office. Just a small, scrappy
                            team with a passion for storytelling and a knack for making the complex feel effortless.
                            Fast forward, and that little idea has grown into Creative Triplet, a 30+ strong crew of
                            creatives, each bringing their own flavor to the mix.<br /><br />

                            We’ve been fortunate enough to partner with some of the world’s leading brands, including
                            P&G, Huawei, and Microsoft. These collaborations have not only fueled our growth but also
                            deepened our understanding of what it takes to create truly impactful videos.<br /><br />

                            More than an animated explainer video company — we’re storytellers, problem- solvers, and
                            excitement creators. We’ve had our share of bumps and breakthroughs, but through it all, one
                            thing’s never changed: our love for making videos that make people feel something.<br /><br />

                            We’re in it for the passion, for the love of what we do, and for the impact we see our work
                            having on the world. And trust us, we’re just getting started. Creative Triplet is all about
                            tripling the impact with creativity.
